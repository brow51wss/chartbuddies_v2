# Chartbuddies Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

1. **Run the database migrations in Supabase SQL Editor (in order):**

   - `supabase-migrations/001_create_admissions_table.sql` (if not already done)
   
   - `supabase-migrations/002_complete_schema.sql` which contains:
     - Complete database schema for hospitals, users, patients, MAR forms
     - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
     - Triggers for auto-updating timestamps
     - Function to auto-create user profiles on signup
   
   - `supabase-migrations/011_add_mar_tracking_fields.sql` which adds:
     - Blood pressure tracking fields (systolic, diastolic) to vital signs
     - Bowel movement tracking field
     - Custom instructions field for vital signs (e.g., "BP (sprinkle salt on food if BP low <80/60)")

2. **Environment Variables:**
   Make sure you have these in your `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

2. **Nurse Signing Up:**

   - Can only see assigned patients

3. **Nurse Workflow:**
   - Login → Dashboard shows assigned patients
   - Click patient → See available forms (MAR, etc.)
   - Create/edit MAR forms for assigned patients

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [x] MAR form view/edit page (to view/continue editing existing forms) ✅
- [ ] Head Nurse/Superadmin dashboard with hospital management
- [ ] Nurse-patient assignment interface
- [ ] Form builder for custom forms
- [ ] Audit log viewing
- [ ] Reports and analytics
- [ ] Separate vital signs sheet (for comprehensive VS tracking)

## Notes
